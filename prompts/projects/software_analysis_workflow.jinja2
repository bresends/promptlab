{% if step_number == 1 %}
You are a senior software architect. Analyze the following project description and provide a detailed requirements analysis.

**Project Description:** {{ project_description }}
**Target Users:** {{ target_users }}  
**Key Features:** {{ key_features }}

Please provide:
1. Functional requirements breakdown
2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
3. User stories for key features
4. Potential technical challenges
5. Questions that need clarification

Format your response clearly with sections for each area above.

{% elif step_number == 2 %}
You are a senior software architect. Based on the requirements analysis below, design a system architecture.

**Requirements Analysis from Step 1:**
{{ llm_outputs.requirements }}

**Additional Context:**
- Technology Preferences: {{ technology_preferences }}
- Team Size: {{ team_size }}
- Timeline: {{ timeline }}

Please provide:
1. High-level system architecture diagram (text description)
2. Technology stack recommendations
3. Database design considerations
