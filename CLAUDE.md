# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Architecture

This is a Flask web application for managing and rendering Jinja2 prompt templates. The core architecture consists of:

- **Flask App Factory Pattern**: `app.py` creates the Flask app with database and migration setup
- **Route Registration**: `router.py` centrally registers all routes from the routes/ directory
- **Prompt Management System**: `prompts/prompt_manager.py` handles discovery, parsing, and rendering of Jinja2 templates with frontmatter metadata
- **Template Organization**: Prompts are organized by category in subdirectories under `prompts/` (e.g., `prompts/youtube/`, `prompts/projects/`)
- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy models in `models/` directory with Flask-Migrate for schema management
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates in `templates/` with TailwindCSS styling

## Key Components

**PromptManager Class**: Central system for template discovery and rendering. It automatically scans the prompts/ directory, extracts frontmatter metadata, identifies Jinja2 variables, and organizes templates by category.

**Route Structure**: Dynamic route handling allows nested prompt paths (e.g., `/youtube/compare_videos/`) to map directly to template files in the prompts/ directory structure.

## Development Commands

**Start Development Server**:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

**Database Migrations**:
```bash
uv run flask db migrate     # Generate migration file
uv run flask db upgrade     # Apply migrations
```

**CSS Build** (TailwindCSS):
```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i static/css/input.css -o static/css/output.css --watch
```

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

The application uses python-dotenv to load from `.env` file.

## Frontend Styling

- The app uses custom Prism.js CSS in /static/css/input.css instead of external Prism CSS libraries. All syntax highlighting styles are defined there and built with TailwindCSS.
